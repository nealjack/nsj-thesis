\chapter{A Simulation-based Exploration of Capacity}
\label{cha:capacity}
In the previous chapter, we presented a simple model for energy capacity and explored the effect of capacity on the amount of energy captured by a system. 
We utilized synthesized energy harvesting traces from an existing irradiance trace dataset, however we simplified the analysis by assuming a static average workload power.
This chapter will explore expanding our model to utilize several different dynamic workloads based off of benchmarks of real hardware, as well as considering a wireless sensor state machine that better captures the behavior of a real sensor.
The rest of the chapter is an analysis of the performance of these simulated wireless sensor workloads under real harvesting conditions.

\section{Upgrading Our Model}
\label{sec:capacity:modelling}
%The model and analysis we presented in \cref{sec:intuition:capacity} does not consider
%workload variability, and simplifies workload to an average.
In \cref{sec:intuition:capacity}, we argued that a sensor workload, which is often periodic or event driven, does not vary significantly beyond a few hours to a day of operation when compared to the variability of energy harvesting income. Photovoltaic harvesting can vary significantly over the course of a day and throughout a year. 
To verify this assumption and expand our analysis of capacity, we seek to to explore the dynamic effects that energy
capacity and backup storage have on sensor performance in the face of workload variability.
We use representative energy harvesting traces, measurements of real hardware,
and synthesized dynamic workloads in a new model based on a simple wireless sensor state machine.
We use this model to simulate
the behavior of energy harvesting sensors. 
From the input traces of workload and energy harvesting income, our model produces estimates of sensor energy utilization, availability, responsiveness, and lifetime.

\placefigure{tab:capacity:rep}

\subsection{Energy Harvesting Income}
As in \cref{sec:intuition:capacity}, we utilize the EnHANTs irradiance trace dataset as energy income for our simulation.
Unlike our previous analysis, we do not use synthesized traces, and instead utilize the traces directly.
We choose to narrow our focus to two of the traces that we think most accurately represent indoor lighting conditions: Setup A and Setup D.
As shown in \cref{fig:intuition:traces}, Setup A represents a location that receives some sunlight but is mostly lit by artificial sources while Setup D represents a location near a window that receives significant light during part of the year.
Beyond \cref{fig:intuition:traces}, these traces are summarized in \cref{tab:capacity:rep}.
On average, Setup A provides an average of 15.1\ssi[per-mode=symbol]{\micro\watt\per\centi\meter\squared} which is on the lower end of expected irradiance in indoor environments. Setup D represents the higher end of indoor irradiance with an average 97.4\ssi[per-mode=symbol]{\micro\watt\per\centi\meter\squared}.

\subsection{Representative Hardware}
We limit our analysis to the effects of capacity,
independent of the differences of energy intensity or efficiency in device
component selection. To do so, we define an example photovoltaic energy harvesting
sensor platform that utilizes currently available commercial
components.
We choose new
components in an attempt to better represent prior energy storage designs and
give them the benefit of the improvements that have occurred in recent years.
We take benchmark
measurements of various tasks performed by this platform, such as the
amount of time and energy required to sample a sensor or send a Bluetooth Low
Energy (BLE) packet. These benchmarks are used to generate energy utilization metrics
for our representative workloads shown in \cref{tab:capacity:rep}.
The physical size of the solar panel used by this sensor
is assumed to be
10.9~cm\textsuperscript{2} and the volume of the sensor node is similar to prior
work like the Hamilton sensor~\cite{kim2018system}.
%We implement this design and describe it further in \cref{sec:impl:permamote}.

\subsection{Representative Workloads}
We find that sensing workloads generally fall into three
categories: (i) periodic sense-and-send~\cite{mainwaring2002wireless}, (ii) reactive event detection~\cite{campbellEnergy14,afanasov2020battery}, and (iii) infrequent,
long-running, high-energy events~\cite{levis2004trickle}. We choose a representative workload for each
of these categories to use in our model.
We characterize our ``periodic sense-and-send''
workload as periodically sampling a light and color sensor and sending a
BLE
advertisement containing the data.
Our ``reactive workload'' is
represented by sending a BLE advertisement upon motion detection of the main
entrance of a university building, and we linearly scale the frequency
of these events to create synthetic traces with varying amounts of usage. 
We treat these workloads as atomic. 
When a packet is sent in response to a periodic schedule or a detected event, the energy spent on sending that packet must be spent instantaneously and atomically.  
Finally, our ``infrequent expensive'' workload is a
contiguous
task that is representative of an
over-the-air firmware update, which is randomly executed with an average occurrence rate
of once every two weeks.
We optimistically assume these long running tasks can be interrupted
and resumed at any point during execution and that any checkpointing does not incur any overhead.

\placefigure[t]{tab:parameters}

\section{An Energy Model for Wireless Sensors}
We use the previously discussed indoor irradiance traces, generalized
workloads, and hardware characterizations to model the behavior of sensors
using different types and sizes of energy storage. We develop an open
source\footnote{\url{https://github.com/lab11/permamote/tree/master/simulator}}
iterative simulator that allows parameterization of various system
characteristics, including regulator efficiency, solar harvester size
and efficiency, energy storage capacity, leakage, equivalent series resistance (ESR), and charge-discharge
efficiency. These parameters are summarized in \cref{tab:parameters}.

The simulation of our model operates as a second-by-second calculation of the
amount of energy entering and exiting a device, similar to the model presented in \cref{sec:intuition:capacity}.
At every step, the simulation calculates the net energy gain or loss of the
system based on its current state and available stored energy.  Occasionally,
the model performs a workload event based on either a periodic schedule (in the
case of a sense-and-send workload) or from a random distribution (reactive
event detection or a high-energy event). For our modeling, workload schedules
are generated from values listed in \cref{tab:capacity:rep}.
This simulation is performed for the entirety of an
input irradiance trace, which constitutes about a year of data. During
a simulation, metrics such as energy utilization, the fraction of completed
events versus expected events, and events' time to completion are collected,
and if applicable, the primary-cell lifetime is estimated from a trace of its capacity over time.

\placefigure{fig:capacity:statemachine}

During simulation, modeled devices can be online or offline and idle or performing
work. These states are shown in \cref{fig:capacity:statemachine}.  A device's state
transitions from top to bottom of this figure and vice versa depending on the
energy state of the secondary storage.
If the secondary-cell energy state drops below \texttt{min\_hyst},
the state of the system moves to the upper
half (\textsf{offline}) of this diagram. The state of the system moves downward (\textsf{online})
if the state of charge of the secondary reaches the \texttt{max\_hyst}
limit. 
Secondary charging hysteresis limits are defined by parameters described in \cref{tab:parameters}.
A device's state can also move
to the right or left of the state machine depending on whether a workload event
is scheduled, or the prescribed workload has been completed. A new
workload event is counted as failed if the device is not in the \textsf{Online
Idle} state when it begins.
In the case of the ``atomic''
sense-and-send and reactive workloads, the modeled device will only begin
to perform an expected workload event if it has
enough energy to perform the event in entirety. If the workload is not atomic,
the device will only begin scheduled work if it has enough energy to make the
configured minimum amount of progress. We
make an assumption that the duration of atomic events are less than the one
second simulation step.
We also assume that a modeled sensor has perfect, zero-energy progress
latching and can go to sleep at any point after an active event. 
If there is energy remaining after performing a task, the modeled sensor will
attempt to spend the rest of the simulation period in the \textsf{Online Idle} state.

If the simulated device is configured with a backup primary-cell, offline
states transform to "primary" states in which the device remains on and
able to perform work, but charges energy usage to the primary storage instead
of the secondary. During these periods, the secondary cell continues charging
from harvested energy. Upon reaching the upper charging hysteresis
limit, the device returns to an online state, using energy stored in the
secondary.  If the primary storage is depleted, the simulation ends early.

\placefigure{fig:usage}

\section{Capacity Increases Energy Capture}
\label{sec:capacity:capture}

In addition to relaxing the need for intermittent techniques, we find that
an increase in sensor energy capacity
achieves a significant return on sensor
reliability and capability in the face of variable energy income.  Higher
energy capacity allows higher energy capture during periods of abundant
harvestable energy.

\subsection{Ambient Energy Utilization}
\label{sec:capacity:utilization}

Ambient energy is underutilized when it is not used to support the specified
sensing application. This may happen for two reasons: 1) 
the secondary
energy storage is full but energy is still available for harvesting, and 2) the
sensor performs work based on its energy state rather than its application
goals. The first scenario is common for energy harvesting systems
presented in prior work that charge up a capacitor and wait for an event
before sensing and sending, failing to capture all energy that may
have been harvested while their capacitor was full~\cite{campbellEnergy14, afanasov2020battery}.
For an example of the second scenario, consider
systems that transmit a packet every time their energy storage capacitor
is full rather than saving this energy for use during periods of lower harvesting
potential~\cite{hesterFlicker17, colinReconfigurable18}. Another example of this are sensors in which the harvesting
rate is proportional to the sensed phenomena~\cite{debruin2013monjolo}.
While compelling for their simplicity, these sensors use
energy that could alternatively be saved and used
later for event detection or tasks like data summarising or analysis.

To explore ambient energy utilization as a function of storage size, we
model the charge-discharge patterns of idealized energy stores under
the harvesting conditions and workloads described in \cref{sec:capacity:modelling}.
We desire to separate capacity from the type of storage, so the
idealized energy storage is assumed to have no leakage or ESR, which often depend if the storage is a capacitor, supercapacitor or battery. 
This modeling is primarily accounting for our first classification of
wasted energy, since our workload definitions \textit{do not} perform
tasks in response to available energy; instead they attempt to maximize the success
rates for the specified sensing tasks.
The results of this modeling are shown in \cref{fig:usage}. 
    %The x-axis is
    %split by energy capacities possible with capacitors, supercapacitors, and
    %batteries. The upper extents of capacity for capacitors represents
    %ten 100\,\si{\micro\farad} tantalum capacitors~\cite{tantalumDatasheet}. 
    %For supercapacitors, the extent is represented by one
    %large 220\,mF supercapacitor~\cite{murataCap}. 
    %These delineations are not hard partitions, as capacitors and supercapacitors have a wide range of capacities. 
    %Larger (super)capacitors exist, but
    %are not appropriate for use on a small sensor node.  
No matter
the amount of available energy, utilization increases as
storage capacity increases. For scenarios with low harvesting potential and high
power workloads, a sensor with at least 1\ssi{\milli\Wh} of storage can accomplish 100\% utilization.
In cases of
high harvesting potential and low power workloads, utilization often
stops increasing before reaching 100\%. This
can be attributed to a small fraction of the available energy being sufficient
to fully support the sensing task.
Small increases in utilization
have significant impact on reliability and system lifetime.
\placefigure{fig:capacity:reliability}
\placefigure{fig:capacity:period}

\subsection{Application Reliability}
\label{sec:store:reliability}

We also model the ability of varying energy stores to meet our defined
sensing tasks and intensities. Our results are
shown in \cref{fig:capacity:reliability}. 
Similar to the results of \cref{sec:store:utilization}, we see marked
increases in performance when energy stores reach 1-10\,mWh
of capacity.
Simulations experience 100\% reliability for all but
the most energy constrained scenarios with high power workloads and
$\geq$2\,mWh of energy storage.
We also see that even when low capacity sensors
have large energy harvesting potentials and infrequent workloads, they experience low
reliability.
This is because they
do not have enough storage to keep sensing throughout the night.

\placefigure{fig:capacity:cdf}

Finally, we analyze the ability of different storage configurations to perform a
random, contiguous, higher energy task. We use a 100\,mJ (30\,\textmu Wh) event that is representative of a
50\,KB over-the-air code update. While this is larger than a code update would be
for simple programs,
we see in \cref{fig:capacity:reliability:otattc} that nearly all of the configurations with
0.28\,mWh of energy storage complete the task in the minimum time (5\,s). In comparison,
even reducing the amount of energy storage to match the amount of energy
required for the code updates causes significant latency. It is clear that
many of the updates for smaller energy storage configurations
do not complete for 1000-10,000\,s.
This aligns with the amount of time a sensor may sit
idle overnight waiting for solar power.

\section{Reliability Requires Backup}
\label{sec:primary}

Increasing secondary capacity greatly improves
reliability.
%for both periodic and reactive workloads.
However, some environmental
conditions and workloads do not reach 100\% reliability regardless of the size
of the secondary store.
%reactive workloads with large secondary
%capacities, some of the
Some results in \cref{fig:capacity:reliability}
appear to achieve perfect reliability, but still miss 0.1-2\% of events.
%with
%diminishing returns for increased secondary capacity.
%Additionally, some workloads
Others achieve well below 100\% reliability, %at the upper extents of storage capacity,
and simply require much more energy
than is harvestable. A backup energy store can increase reliability of a system
to 100\%, at the cost of a finite lifetime.
%In both of these case, further increasing secondary
%capacity does not improve reliability.
%and the desired application cannot rely soly on harvested power.
%and we expect that
%workloads which achieve slightly less than perfect reliability are experiencing
%a combination of brief harvesting droughts and high amounts of temporally local activity
%that push the local average power well above that of the average harvested power.
%While the second case may be solved with a sufficiently large secondary-cell, the
%diminishing returns of increasing secondary size and
%unpredictability of some reactive applications
%makes it difficult to rely solely on harvested power.

\subsection{Reliability Required}
\label{sec:primary:reliability}

We argue that 100\% reliability is a significant improvement over
even low failure rates with respect to reliability
%information
%for many applications
and simplicity due to the lack of intermittency.
%that is a consequence
%of reliability.
Many applications, especially human facing ones,
must be reliable to function, and research shows that unreliability
leads to frustration and %lack of
unwillingness to adopt automated solutions~\cite{brushHome11, edwardsHome01, shehanHome07}.
To use energy harvesting sensors for control or feedback of systems with potential
safety issues, inherent unreliability is intolerable.

Worse, intermittent system failures are difficult to detect %and mitigate
because there is no method for distinguishing between lack of energy
and an actual fault. While scheduled communication of current energy state
may help, this would be difficult for systems that only store enough
energy to perform a single operation such as Flicker~\cite{hesterFlicker17},
Gecko~\cite{yervaGrafting12}, and some configurations of
Capybara~\cite{colinReconfigurable18}.

Finally, it is more difficult
to program intermittent systems because programmers or the underlying
programming model must monitor and adapt to available energy with fine
granularity, both of which are non-trivial tasks.
These systems have little ability to correct for failures
even when they are detected.
%A reliable system has the ability to spend more short-term
%energy to correct for detected failures.

\subsection{Lifetime of a Backup Energy Store}
\label{sec:primary:lifetime}

To achieve 100\% reliability and avoid intermittency,
designs can utilize a backup energy store.
%that is pre-charged at the start of the
%node's life.
In instances where the rechargeable source is depleted, the system
can operate from the backup, masking the effects of variable energy income.
When the backup energy store is depleted, we consider the node's lifetime
to be complete, although it could continue
operating intermittently and with lower reliability. This energy store should
be a primary-cell, as they offer very low self-discharge, long shelf life, and
substantial energy density.
%This pre-charged energy store could be accomplished
%by either a large secondary-cell or a primary-cell, but to avoid increasing
%volume significantly this energy store will almost certainly manifest itself
%as a non-rechargeable battery.

An analysis of the reliable lifetime of a node with both energy
harvesting and a backup energy store is shown in \cref{fig:primary}.
%for
%both periodic and event based workloads.
We choose several backup energy
stores with energy equivalent to those found in several types of common
primary-cells. We see that with energy harvesting and a sufficiently
large secondary energy store, nodes can
achieve 100\% reliable lifetimes that exceed
what we can reasonably predict, especially for harvesting scenarios that
exceed the average power of the application. In these scenarios, 
the inclusion of a backup energy store is critical 
to ensure reliability in uncharacteristically adverse conditions.
Even for conditions with
limited energy availability we still observe significant lifetime improvements
due to energy harvesting.

    \caption{\normalfont Representative harvesting conditions and workloads.
    To evaluate different energy harvesting storage techniques, we define a set of energy harvesting
    conditions and workloads that are representative of common sensing applications. We choose two
    real irradiance traces with different magnitudes and distributions of available energy.
    These traces are summarized in \cref{tab:capacity:rep_trace}.
    We define three
    workloads: periodic, reactive, and long-running, and we characterize those workloads
    for different event frequencies. The energy used for each event is measured
    on our reference hardware described in \cref{sec:impl:permamote}.
    Statistics for the three workloads are described in \cref{tab:capacity:rep_work}.

      A subset of available configuration options for the sensor energy simulation. 
      Simulated sensors can be configured to use 
      secondary storage and an energy harvester, a
      primary-cell, or both. A secondary-cell can be configured with a
      hysteresis, with a lower bound set to \texttt{min\_hyst}
      and an upper bound of \texttt{max\_hyst}.
      %This upper bound must represent
      %the minimum amount of
      %energy to do useful work.
      %Therefore, the upper bound of charging
      %hysteresis is set to \texttt{secondary\_max\_hyst}.
      %Workloads are
      %configured to be either periodic or reactive, and workload intensity is
      %determined by period, or a scaling factor determining the average number
      %of events picked from a random distribution.

    \caption{\normalfont Model state machine.
    A modeled device can be in one of four states: \textsf{Offline Idle},
    \textsf{Online Idle}, \textsf{Online Working}, and \textsf{Offline
    Working}. When a device is \textsf{Offline Idle}, it has run out of energy
    and is off. If a device is \textsf{Online
    Idle}, it is on and in deep sleep, ready to perform work if triggered. If
    triggered, a device moves to \textsf{Online Working}, where it performs a
    portion of a work event.  If a workload is atomic, workload events
    \textit{must} be completed in one \textsf{Online Working} step, without any
    transitions to an offline state.  \textsf{Offline Working} means that while
    working on a non-atomic task, the device ran out of energy, checkpointed,
    and is waiting to harvest more and resume its task.  For devices
    configured with a primary-cell, \textsf{Offline Idle} and \textsf{Offline
    Working} become \textsf{\textcolor{primary-blue}{Primary Idle}} and
    \textsf{\textcolor{primary-blue}{Primary Working}} respectively.  In these
    states, outgoing energy is charged against the primary-cell and the device
    remains online and able to perform work for the life of the primary-cell.
    %State transitions are determined by incoming energy, the state of charge of
    %the secondary storage, and the generated work schedule from workload
    %parameters.
