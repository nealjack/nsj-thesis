%After its inception, the utilization of wireless sensor networks has largely been limited to industrial settings, and some niche commercial and consumer applications. The current state of wireless, distributed computing is still a far cry from Mark Weiser's vision of ubiquitous and calm computing. I believe this to be largely due to the cost of deploying and maintaining a system of wireless sensor networks. \hl{what cost? monetary, time, environmental?} For many applications, this cost often outweighs the benefit of enabling the application itself.

%A wireless sensor deployment must provide sufficient value in its use case and additionally not impose an undue burden (monetary cost, time, environmental) of deployment, maintenance, and eventual replacement.

\section{Thesis Statement}

A simulation driven design framework provides better guidance for system design than current energy harvesting intuition and highlights that contemporary solutions are significantly under provisioning energy capacity. Systems built with design points determined through simulation provide higher availability, lower latency, long lifetimes, and the capability of supporting more energy intensive applications, all without the need for complex intermittent techniques.
