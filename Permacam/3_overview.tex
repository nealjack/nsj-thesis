%\section{Platform Overview}
%The \name{} platform is a wireless camera system capable of a 5 year lifetime with common workloads. In the following sections, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of the platform. \name\, consists of COTS components, including a low power wireless Cortex M4F SoC, an ultra-low power image sensor, a passive infrared (PIR) occupancy sensor, and an illuminance sensor. The camera used on \name\, is capable of capturing 320x320 color images. The sensor platform is powered by hierarchical energy storage that consists of a photo-voltaic panel that harvests energy and stores it in a small rechargeable (secondary) battery and a backup non-rechargeable (primary) battery. The platform prioritizes using energy from the rechargeable battery if it is available, and falls back to the non-rechargeable cell if needed to maintain reliability. The key components of the platform are depicted in \cref{fig:block}.

%\name{} is capable of performing some local inference on captured images, like two-class classification tasks (is a person in the image or not). The platform is also able to send images end-to-end to hosts capable of more complex inference like object detection and tracking. In the next section, we detail the design of \name, and explore the limitations and benefits of local inference compared to end-to-end image transfer.
