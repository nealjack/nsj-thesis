\chapter{Implementation and Evaluation of Capacity Sizing}
\label{chap:permacam}

This chapter considers two example sensing applications and the design of wireless sensor systems to achieve the goals of these applications.
We explore the system design for these applications within the context of the conclusions of \cref{chap:intuition,chap:capacity,chap:battery}, which suggest that energy capacity is a first order concern for energy harvesting wireless sensor design.
The first application that we consider is the measurement of fine-grained workplane illuminance. These illuminance measurements are used to inform the operation of a lighting control system to balance artificial and natural light for occupant's workplanes. 
The goals of this application are to measure illuminance at high granularity with high availability and provide a lifetime of at least a decade. 
This application is relatively simple and it is used to validate the simulation and conclusions presented in \cref{chap:intuition,chap:capacity}.
The second application is image-based human occupancy detection and counting. 
Human occupancy measurement can help inform building energy management and climate control.
The goal of this application is to accurately and consistently detect the presence of humans within view while providing a lifetime of several years.
This application considers existing image sensing solutions and reconsiders their design in the context of the conclusions of previous chapters.
This chapter finishes with an examination of the power and energy trends of image-based sensing application requirements and a few predictions for the future of energy harvesting wireless sensor applications and design. 

\section{Measuring Workplane Illuminance}
\label{sec:impl:permamote}

%We discuss the implementation of both the model used to generate the results
%of \cref{sec:store} and \cref{sec:primary}, and the \name hardware that
%is based on these results. All of our hardware and software will be made
%\textbf{open source} for use by other researchers.

The advent of LED lighting has significantly reduced electricity consumption in residential and commercial sectors. However, residential and commercial lighting still consumes 5\% of the \textit{total} U.S. electrical consumption~\cite{aeo2022}.
Beyond the utilization of LED lighting, the technique of daylighting, or lighting buildings with natural light, can further reduce the amount of electricity consumed by buildings. 
Since the intensity of daylight can be unpredictable as it depends on weather, it can be difficult to achieve consistent lighting with natural light alone.
Artificial lighting can be used to augment insufficient natural light, but it requires fine-grained measurement to provide feedback to control and maintain a set point in a space.
In particular, workplane illuminance for commercial buildings is important for occupant comfort and productivity, but is difficult to maintain with existing lighting control systems. 
Modern lighting control systems that perform both measurement and control are generally limited to large zones of measurement and influence. 
The cost of instrumentation and automation is often too exorbitant to justify fine-grained more fine-grained focus.
This often results in inequitable and sometimes uncomfortable lighting for occupants.
Wireless sensing could provide a solution for fine-grained workplane measurement for daylighting applications, assuming the sensor does not require frequent maintenance and provides high availability and consistent measurements for the lighting system feedback loop.
For this specific example, our application goals are to provide at least a ten year lifetime with consistently high availability. 
This section details the realization of a design to meet these requirements, and utilizes this design to verify our the results of the simulation and design conclusions detailed in earlier chapters.

\placefigure{fig:permamote}

\subsection{Design and Implementation}
We design and implement a prototype sensor named \name to perform workplane illuminance sensing based on the application requirements described previously and the design principals discussed in \cref{chap:capacity,chap:battery}.
%The \name sensing platform
%utilizes the components from the representative hardware listed in \cref{tab:capacity:components} 
%used in our simulation. 
\name integrates a processor, BLE/802.15.4 radio, and various environmental, lighting,
and a passive infrared (PIR) occupancy sensor.
The components used in \name are the same ones that we used to develop our representative hardware and workloads for our simulation. 
These components are listed in \cref{tab:capacity:components}. 
A picture
and system diagram of \name is shown in \cref{fig:permamote}. All hardware
and software for the platform is open source\footnote{\url{https://github.com/lab11/permamote/tree/master/hardware/permamote}}.

\placefigure{fig:impl:permamote_life}
\subsubsection{Energy Harvesting and Storage.}
Some of the primary goals of \name are to provide workplane illuminance measurements with high availability for a long lifetime of greater than ten years. 
Given the results of our simulation, a design that relies solely on energy preallocation is unlikely to achieve a sufficiently long lifetime. 
\name is powered by an energy harvesting front end that capitalizes on the benefits
of rechargeable and non-rechargeable energy capacity. 
It utilizes the TI BQ25505 energy harvesting IC, which
harvests energy while monitoring both
rechargeable and backup energy stores,
switching between them at user-configurable voltage thresholds~\cite{bq25505}. 

We utilize the hueristics developed in \cref{sec:intuition:capacity} to determine the required sizing for our energy harvesting and energy storage. 
We select a 10.9\ssi{\centi\meter\squared} amorphous
silicon photovoltaic panel as our energy harvester.
This photovoltaic panel can provide between an average of 7--70\ssi{\micro\watt} assuming the conservative bounds of indoor irradiance (10--100\ssi[per-mode=symbol]{\micro\watt\per\centi\meter\squared}).
On average, this range can provide sufficient average power to support various frequencies of the sense and send workload.
We can consult \cref{fig:intuition:capacity_sweep,fig:intuition:capacity_margin} to estimate the minimum required capacity for the sense and send workload.
Considering the average power required by the sense and send workload with a 30 second period (24.5\ssi{\micro\watt}), 
the minimum sufficient capacity should be between \num{7.9E5} and \num{1.8E6} times the average workload power. This is if we assume an income distribution similar to the EnHANTs Setup D and a workload margin between 20--50\% the expected income power.
This suggests the capacity of the rechargeable energy storage should be between 20--44\ssi{\milli\Wh}.
This agrees with results from our simulation in \cref{fig:capacity:availability} suggesting energy capacity on the order of 10\ssi{\milli\Wh} will be sufficient to achieve near perfect availability in conditions like Setup D captures.
We select a 20\ssi{\milli\Ah} (48\ssi{\milli\Wh}) LTO battery 
to achieve this energy capacity~\cite{LTODatasheet, LTODatasheet2}.
As described in \cref{sec:battery:life},
we configure the voltage thresholds of the BQ25505 to derate the 
usable capacity of this battery to  
increase the apparent cycle lifetime of the battery. 
The resulting energy storage provides 24\ssi{\milli\Wh} of
energy storage, more than the capacity required to achieve the reliability and energy utilization
improvements of the workloads that were simulated in \cref{sec:capacity:primary,fig:capacity:primary}.

In some cases, the available harvestable power may be insufficient to operate in an energy neutral fashion even though we have sized the rechargeable battery correctly.
This justifies the addition of a reliable, non-rechargeable backup energy source.
\Cref{fig:impl:permamote_life} is a recreation of \cref{fig:capacity:primary} presenting the estimated lifetime of \name with its configured 24\ssi{\micro\Wh} rechargeable storage and various non-rechargeable backup energy storage options. We assume a 30 second sense and send workload period.
From this simulation result, \name requires at least one CR2032 coin cell to achieve the application lifetime goals in the worst case energy harvesting potential.
Thus, \name is designed to be configured with either one or two CR2032 coin
cells or a CR123A cell. 
%Primary-cells provide 3-13x more density and 2-12x less
%leakage than a secondary-cell.
%making them more desirable than a single,
%large, pre-charged secondary-cell as the backup store~\cite{LTODatasheet,primary2032, primarycr123a}.
The output of the active battery
is boosted by a MAX17222 regulator, which features high conversion efficiency
(>90\%) at low output currents and operates down to 400\,mV~\cite{max17222}.
%We have the ability to monitor harvesting and system currents using
%the iCount method by sensing the voltage of
%the inductor used by the BQ25505 and MAX17222~\cite{duttaEnergy08}. The processor
%is also capable of gating all sensors from the main power supply to save
%power.\\

\subsubsection{Processor, Radio and Sensor Selection}
In designing \name, we strive to select modern and low power components.
%We feel that it may
To benefit other
platform builders, we document our component selections
along with their key performance metrics. A summary of these
components can be found in \cref{tab:capacity:components}.

We note our choice of the Nordic NRF52840 MCU over the more commonly used MSP430FR series
because of its higher active power efficiency while offering comparable sleep currents.
Specifically, it only draws 56\,\uA/MHz compared to over 100\,uA/MHz
for the MSP430, which is a common choice for batteryless systems. 
Unlike batteryless systems,
\name is designed with sufficient rechargeable capacity and backup energy and is intended to never power off and lose volatile state. 
This eliminates any reliance on state retention techniques and the need for the non-volatile FRAM present on the MSP430FR series chips. 
While
slightly more efficient
processors and radios exist than those found in the NRF52840,
we value the simplicity of the SoC-based design. 

\subsection{Simulation Evaluation using Real Systems}
\label{sec:eval}
To evaluate our simulation and the benefits of a capacity-focused design, 
we perform a three-month-long deployment in a partially sunlit room
using i) a primary-cell only system~\cite{adkins2015michigan}, ii) a batteryless, capacitor-only system~\cite{campbellEnergy14}, and iii) \name, our
system that features both a secondary and primary-cell. 
We model these
systems over the same period using estimated irradiance from \name illuminance masurements. 
We compare the performance and lifetime of these three systems with the predictions generated by a simulation of their workload. 
We also compare the availability of \name to the batteryless system.

%\subsubsection{Simulating Sense and Send with \name}
%We perform benchmarks on the \name platform to develop the workloads presented in \cref{sec:capacity:modelling}.
%The workplane illuminance measurement application represents the same periodic sense and send workload used in our simulation.
%\name requires a total of 586\ssi{\micro\joule} to measure from its light and color sensors and transmit
%the results in a BLE advertisement.
%Out of this event energy, 86\ssi{\micro\joule}
%is required to transmit a single BLE advertisement at 0\,dbm. 
%Additionally, the entire system, including
%the energy harvesting front end, consumes only 5.0\,\uW in deep sleep with volatile state  
%retention and all sensors powered off. 
%We use the energy numbers from \name as a basis
%for our simulation workloads to fairly compare against prior energy storage architectures.

We analyze the deployment of the systems 
%in a partially sunlit room for three months
and compare their behavior to our
model's predictions: i) ten CR2032 primary-cell (720\ssi{\milli\Wh}) only devices, ii) an
batteryless system configured with just 500\textmu F of capacitance (about
0.36\,\textmu Wh at 2.2\,V), and iii) \name, configured with a 20\,mAh
(48\,mWh) secondary-cell, half of which is usable, and a CR2032 backup.  The
primary-cell only device performs environmental sensing over BLE every second.
The batteryless system  sends a beacon as soon as its capacitor bank is full.
When its energy is depleted, it powers off and charges
again. \name is running the ``sense and send'' workload that we described in
\cref{sec:capacity:modelling}, and sends illuminance measurements every second. This
workload stresses the model and requires more charge and discharge cycles.  We
use \name illuminance readings to estimate irradiance using the same scaling factors used by
Yerva et al.~\cite{yervaGrafting12}, and use these traces as
model input for the energy harvesting sensors.

\subsubsection{Primary-Cell Only}
We measure and model the workload of the primary-cell system and produce estimates for
lifetime. The primary cell system requires on average 480\ssi{\micro\watt} to measure and beacon every second. Our model predicts the platform lifetime
to be 58 days.  We find that the average lifetime of the 10 devices is 61 days.
%,
%from initial deployment to energy depletion, is 61 days.

\placefigure{fig:impl:eval_pkt}
\subsubsection{Batteryless}
We model the number of packets sent each hour by the
batteryless system over a three week period, and compare against the results of an actual device in
\cref{fig:eval:pkt}.
Like the simulation of the primary cell system, the model also predicts a more conservative result for the batteryless system. 
The simulation predicts fewer successful packets sent compared to the actual batteryless system under test. 
The average daily error of the model versus our results is 15\%, with a standard deviation of
17\%. This error can attributed to two primary sources. Illuminance is measured
close to, but not exactly at the solar panel of the test device. Occasional
direct sunbeams, like that experienced on day 16, can illuminate the solar
panel but not the sensor, or vice versa. This
results in a substantial over or underestimate of available light. In addition
to inaccurate light measurements, we introduce error through our estimation of
irradiance. We measure illuminance
instead of irradiance, and must resort to a piecewise linear estimation, when
in reality the relationship is not well defined and non-linear when considering
different light sources~\cite{michael2020conversion}. In the case of our estimation, results
indicate that the model consistently underestimates high irradiance measurements.

\placefigure{fig:impl:eval_soc}
\subsubsection{Secondary and Primary-Cell}
We compare our model's predicted state of charge to a deployed \name over a seven
day period in \cref{fig:eval:soc}. We estimate state of charge from the reported secondary-cell
voltage,
%,
%and measured voltage
%curves of the installed 20\,mAh battery
and irradiance from
lux measurements. In this figure, the state of
charge cycles between configured battery hysteresis limits, as the workload is
too intense to be sustained by energy harvesting alone.
%and the Permamote must
%use energy from its primary cell.
Flat and upward slopes of the curve represent the
device in hysteresis, using the primary battery to perform its workload. Upper slopes
indicate the secondary cell is charging from harvested energy.
Downward slopes indicate the device is out of hysteresis and is using harvested
energy stored in its secondary battery to perform its workload.
%The device is
%charging and in
%hysteresis during upward
%slopes.
The shaded ``nighttime'' regions are not uniform, as the
deployment environment is occupied by graduate students that occasionally work
late hours or forget to turn off the lights.  The model correctly predicts the
cycling
behavior of the deployed device for two days, but deviates
during the third day. The model predicts that the device would charge above the upper
hysteresis limit and begin supplying energy from the secondary-cell before the
test device actually does.  This inaccuracy, like that of the last of
experiment, is partially due to our inexact estimation of irradiance.  In
addition, real device hysteresis limits are set using resistor networks.  The
resistors used have 1-5\% tolerance, and are susceptible to temperature
changes, which introduces dynamic errors that is not accounted for in our model.
Even though the predicted state of charge deviates after two days, the length
and frequency of periods in which harvested energy is stored and used %in the secondary-cell
are identical to our experimental measurements. 
The amount of energy that is charged and discharged from the secondary cell is also identical.
%While our model correctly predicts cycling timing and frequency, it appears the
%state of charge  does not quite match that of the measurements.  This is
%because the voltage measured is not the open circuit voltage, and is affected
%by voltage droop due to the applied system load as well as inflated charging
%voltage from the energy harvesting front end.  Ignoring these effects, the
%cycling of the model's prediction is closely synchronized with the estimated
%state of charge.
%We compare the model's predicted
%state of charge over time to the outputs of systems we
%have deployed. For energy harvesting systems we collect lux measurements
%throughout the deployment and convert lux to irradiance based on the
%data collected in Yerva et al.~\cite{yervaGrafting12}. \\

\subsection{\name Performance and Lifetime}
\placefigure[t]{fig:evalcmp}
\label{sec:eval:permamote}
%In addition to evaluating our model,
We also compare the performance of the
deployed batteryless system and \name. In \cref{fig:evalcmp}, we show the
number of packets sent per hour for two days. \name sends data every
second, while the batteryless system sends as fast as possible. \name is
able to collect and send its data continuously, while the
batteryless system is limited to sending only during the day. This
demonstrates the increased availability afforded by increasing secondary
capacity and including a backup energy store.

We also use our model to explore the estimated performance of \name
compared to the power supply architectures of historical systems for workloads including our illuminance sense and send application and the other applications defined in \cref{sec:capacity:modelling}.
To isolate the analysis to just power supply types and sizing, we assume each
system uses the same low-power hardware and is performing the same workload as \name.
The results of this modeling are shown in \cref{tab:related}. Our model estimates that
\name can expect several decades of 100\% reliable lifetime when configured as
it was deployed for this evaluation, albeit configured with a less intense workload.
%While the workload used with \name is not
%sustainable for the multi-decade lifetimes we are targeting, it still
%exemplifies the increase in reliability afforded by including a primary-cell.

\placefigure{tab:related}

\subsection{Summary}
The design of \name encapsulates the conclusions from \cref{chap:intuition}, \cref{chap:capacity}, and \cref{chap:battery} to develop a long-lived and highly available solution for illuminance sensing.
We avoid adhering to a single design strategy, such as a batteryless or preallocation-only design.
Instead, we consider the requirements of the application and identify the type and size of energy harvesting, rechargeable buffers, and non rechargeable storage to achieve these goals.
We utilize results of our analysis and simulation to make these design decisions.
The end result is a hybrid energy harvesting system that utilizes a rechargeable LTO battery for buffering, and either coin cell or cylindrical non-rechargeable batteries for backup.
Through simulation, we show that this design can achieve the application goals, and is estimated to be able to provide more than a decade lifetime with high availability.

    of 17\%. (b) We model and measure a \name's state of charge while running a
    ``sense and send'' workload with a 1\,s period for a week, beginning at
    midnight on the first day. Charging hysteresis
    limits of the devices are set at 51\% and 43\%. 
    Shaded regions represent periods of low harvestable potential

    closely track the experimental measurements. Errors
    in hysteresis and irradiance estimation cause the model to reach its upper
    hysteresis sooner than the experiment does, annotated by the
    \textbf{\textcolor{fig-green}{green circle}}. In actuality, the device

    \textbf{\textcolor{fig-purple}{purple square}}.
    More importantly, the

\section{Image-based Occupancy Detection}
Besides the utilization of LED lighting and daylighting, another way to increase lighting efficiency in buildings is to automate lighting power states based on human occupancy.
Human occupancy is also a useful metric for regulating building heating and cooling.
The presence and number of people in a space directly effects the amount of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) a building must perform to maintain a temperature set point~\cite{wei2020deep}.
Compared to lighting, building HVAC is much more energy intensive, with cooling consisting of 10\% of the total U.S. electricity consumption in 2021~\cite{aeo2022}. 
Occupancy is measured in lighting control systems, however they often rely on a binary indication of occupancy based on simple ultrasonic or PIR motion detection~\cite{levitonDecora}.
This technique can not quantify the occupancy of a space, and it is prone to false positives and negatives.
Non-human objects that move through a space can trigger an ultrasonic sensor, while any rapid changes in surface temperatures can result in false positives for a PIR sensor.
When a person is not moving sufficiently, both ultrasonic and PIR sensors may sense a false negative.
Instead of, or in addition to these binary occupancy measurements, image sensing can be used to more accurately capture the occupancy, including person count, of a space.
Image inference, including classification and object detection, has been one of the most active areas of modern computer science and machine learning research. 
However, due to the cost and difficulty of deploying wired cameras, long-lived applications based on continuous image sensing has traditionally been untenable.
This is especially true for indoor building-centric applications, where camera density must be higher for sufficient coverage and lifetime must be sufficient to avoid frequent maintenance.

\subsection{Related Work}
Indoor wireless camera sensors have been heavily researched and commercialized over the past fifteen years, but due to the technology available at the time, as well as incompatibilities between design decisions and longevity, these platforms are typically limited to lifetimes of at most weeks to months~\cite{rowe2007firefly,rahimi2005cyclops,blinkindoor,wyzeoutdoor,josephson2019wireless}. 
Deployment of these platforms beyond small or temporary installations remain a challenge due to the cost of frequent battery replacement.
%With the confluence of new and improved COTS technology, like low power processors, radios, and image sensors, it is worth revisiting the design of wireless camera sensors. 

Modern image sensing platforms have taken advantage of technology improvements, as well as employed new techniques to reduce transmit power and increase (or abolish) lifetime. WISPCam~\cite{naderiparizi2015wispcam}, is a battery-free camera that utilizes RFID for power and backscatter communication. It can capture an image every 15 minutes when an RFID reader is 5 meters away. BackCam~\cite{josephson2019wireless} is  another camera platform that utilizes backscatter for communication, but over commodity WiFi. BackCam can stream video at 4 frames per second for a lifetime of 32 days. Similar to WISPCam, BackCam also requires a nearby wall-powered transmitter to generate excitation packets for backscatter communication. Camaroptera~\cite{nardello2019camaroptera} is another batteryless platform, focused on wide-area image sensing. 
The platform uses a long-range LoRa radio and harvests energy from solar panels. It performs local inference to detect people within captured photos and can achieve an end-to-end latency of less than 20 seconds in well-lit outdoor environments. Commercial platforms like the Blink Indoor wireless security camera~\cite{blinkindoor} and the Wyze outdoor camera~\cite{wyzeoutdoor} utilize low power motion detection to minimize energy usage. The Blink Indoor claims a 2 year lifetime consisting of 40000 seconds of recording 720p video on two AA batteries. Wyze estimates a lifetime of three to six months on its internal 5.2\,Ah battery if capturing 10 to 20 video clips per day.

While these modern platforms push the envelop for video streaming or batteryless imaging, they have drawbacks that limit their deployability in indoor spaces. Backscatter-based systems require a nearby transmitter to communicate. Even with a dedicated, nearby transmitter, WISPCam can only periodically capture images every 15 minutes. Camaroptera is designed for outdoor use, and it is unclear how frequent it can capture and send images indoors, especially as its energy harvesting system requires 197\,\uW when idle. 
The Blink camera lasts two years if it is placed in locations infrequently occupied by people. Placing the camera in a kitchen that sees an average 26\% occupancy on weekdays leads to a lifetime of only 1.78 days \cite{josephson2019wireless}. The Wyze camera faces a similar fate if placed in a frequently occupied area.

Image sensing platforms developed by industry and in research exhibit the same design disconnect that we noted in \cref{chap:background}. Commercial image sensing systems largely utilize batteries and avoid energy harvesting, while modern research systems are largely energy harvesting and batteryless.
These two different design result in a deceptive choice between reliable operation with a preallocated energy source but a limited lifetime, or an unlimited but unreliable lifetime with batteryless energy harvesting.
Neither option is satisfactory for many applications, including our indoor human occupancy detection example application that simultaneously demands a long sensor lifetime and high availability.

\subsection{The Design and Performance of a Batteryless Image Sensor}
In this dissertation, we have argued that a batteryless approach is not appropriate for applications with QoS requirements. Designers of batteryless systems rarely evaluate their platforms and frameworks in regards to availability and reliability. However, utilizing the heuristics and simulation tools we have developed in \cref{chap:intuition,chap:capacity}, we can estimate the performance of these systems and identify alternate design decisions that may result in a more performant image sensing system.

In this section, we consider the design and performance of Camaroptera, a batteryless image sensor
~\cite{nardello2019camaroptera,desai2022camaroptera}.
We capture the design details of Camaroptera and use them to simulate the system and examine its performance.
Camaroptera is designed as a primarily outdoor system, and utilizes LoRa for communication and image backhaul.
It performs local inference to detect people in captured frames. A positive detection results in transmitting an image, and if no person is detected, it discards the captured image to preserve energy. 
It harvests solar energy with four small high-efficiency monocrystaline solar panels and stores this energy in a 33\ssi{\milli\farad} supercapacitor.
Camaroptera, like many batteryless systems, operates opportunistically. 
Whenever its capacitor is charged sufficiently, it performs its workload. 
Camaroptera's workload consists of capturing an image, performing some computations and inference on this image, compressing the image, and finally transmitting the packetized image. 
Camaroptera's energy storage is sized to the most energy intensive operation in its workload: transmitting a single LoRa packet.
A single packet can not fit an entire compressed image, so Camaroptera relies on multiple power cycles to send between seven and eight packets to transmit an entire image.
All combined, a single image capture and transmission requires 2.1\ssi{\joule}\footnote{3.06 (capture) + 0.253 (difference) + 66 (inference) + 40 (jpeg) + 288$\times$7 (transmission) = 2125 \ssi{\milli\joule}~\cite{desai2022camaroptera}}.
When idle, Camaroptera's power subsystem consumes 197\ssi{\micro\watt}.
With this information, along with operation timing provided by the authors~\cite{desai2022camaroptera}, we are able to complete a simulation configuration like \cref{tab:capacity:parameters} for Camaroptera's hardware design and workload.

For energy income, we synthesize an outdoor irradiance trace based on the EnHANTs Setup D trace. 
The authors evaluated Camaroptera from 5--95\ssi{\kilo\lux}, which roughly corresponds to 4--77\ssi[per-mode=symbol]{\milli\watt\per\centi\meter\squared} for natural light\footnote{For natural sunlight: 1\ssi[per-mode=symbol]{\watt\per\meter\squared} $\approx$ 122\ssi{\lux}~\cite{michael2020conversion}}.
We scale the mean of the Setup D trace to represent 10 and 50 \ssi[per-mode=symbol]{\milli\watt\per\centi\meter\squared} for an estimate of outdoor irradiance on the same scale.

%Recent improvements in microcontrollers go beyond lower power improvements\cite{kim2018system}. Many embedded processors now include hardware floating point, single cycle multiplies, and data-parallel instruction (SIMD) support. The promise of new dedicated accelerators provides the potential of significant improvements in inference performance on low power systems~\cite{armm55,himaxwiseeye}. This has led to renewed interest in performing complex local inference on a battery budget, especially as transmitting large data like images is traditionally very expensive. However, radios have also become far more power efficient, which again muddies the conventional wisdom. Indeed, it is now much cheaper to transmit large data to a more capable system. Desktop or server class machines handily outclass their low power microcontroller and accelerator brethren on performance, providing the ability to perform more complex and accurate inference, if only data can be efficiently delivered to them.
%%Regardless of recent improvements, microcontroller and accelerator performance will continue to pale in comparison to desktop and server class computing systems. 
%This is especially true as memory has not scaled at the same pace as processing.
%This rapidly changing design space points to a requirement for a flexible architecture and framework for thinking about what applications are most suited for local processing versus cloud offload.
%% or data transmission.
%
%In this section, we present \name, the first wireless, energy-harvesting camera platform capable of capturing and transmitting an image every ten minutes for half a decade in indoor environments.
%\name represents a culmination of recent work on low power camera sensors~\cite{josephson2019wireless,nardello2019camaroptera,naderiparizi2015wispcam} and energy harvesting sensor platforms~\cite{jackson2019capacity}. \name features a hierarchical energy harvesting system that couples a small rechargeable battery with a backup non-rechargeable battery. This combination provides the system with a long and reliable lifetime. The longevity and reliability of the platform make it suitable for long-term, low-maintenance deployments. Images captured by \name are capable of driving applications like people detection and counting. 
%With default, pretrained weights, an object detection model is able to detect a person in \name images from 20 meters away.
%
%\name is capable of performing both local inference and transmitting full images end-to-end to more powerful systems. Local inference potentially requires less energy than image transmission, and also provides significantly better privacy guarantees. In cases where privacy is not as much of a concern, image transmission to a more capable endpoint increases the flexibility and performance of inference run on images. Privacy can still be guaranteed if images are transmitted only within a local network.
%We examine the implications of both architectural choices with respect to capability, energy, and latency.
%
%Our results show that on modern SoCs, transmitting images surprisingly enables longer lifetimes and improved inference. While this conclusion is unique to indoor wireless camera sensors 
%whose footprints are not dominated by their energy harvester or storage, its general methodology can be applied to other application spaces as well.
%%
%Through this conclusion, we develop an end-to-end architecture that makes images captured by \name accessible to data collectors and application builders. \name provides a scalable and easily deployable method to quickly gather visual data for machine learning training or datasets. Images collected by \name are easily integrated into popular computer vision and machine learning frameworks like OpenCV, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. Using these tools, high level applications can be built to drive visual applications like building occupancy counting for more efficient energy management and critical infrastructure monitoring atop a long-lived deployment of wireless \name devices.
