% what does power subsystem need to provide? 
% upsizing battery? what are interfaces
% as you increase size of charge buffer, size of amount of buffering you have for small variations goes away
% big cap squelch high frequency, keep increasing further and further, squelch over day, week, year
%contininuity of buffer, hard to reason over intermittency, easy to reason about how to buffer over it
%0.1uF noise, 10 uF surge, larger 100uF stabilize power supply, even larger mF operate store charge for a workload, only good for one activation
%continium on buffer capacity
